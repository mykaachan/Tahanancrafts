                Spanish colonial architecture and rich cultural heritage. Known as

              In a quiet corner of Ibaan, Batangas, the rhythmic clack of wooden
              looms tells a story of patience, resilience, and pride. The women of
              the SM Sunrise Weaving Association gather each day, weaving not just
              threads but the legacy of “Habing Ibaan”—a handloom craft passed down
              through generations.
